    "description": "PQAKA is a Post-Quantum Authentication and Key Agreement protocol designed for 5G-based V2X communication in the Intelligent Internet of Vehicles (IIoV). It integrates NIST-standardized ML-KEM to provide mutual authentication and forward secrecy, ensuring security against both classical and quantum attacks. The protocol is formally verified using ProVerif and supported by informal security analysis. Performance is evaluated through computational and communication cost analysis and simulations, demonstrating PQAKA’s practicality for quantum-resilient vehicular networks.",
